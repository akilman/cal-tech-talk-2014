            <p>Or, some things that you probably don't think matter, <br/>but actually really do matter.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                Besides telling you about AppDynamics, Matt and I thought
                it would be nice to give you something more generally useful.

                We thought we could give you some unsolicited advice for your
                first year after college.

                You might be thinking "why the hell should I listen to this guy?
                He's just some alum from five years ago recruting for some random company!"

                Which is totally reasonable. I don't expect you to just take my word
                on this stuff. Instead, listen to my arguments and see if you're convinced.

                And I welcome discussion during this part, so please interrupt me
                if you have questions.

            <h2>1) Do code reviews</h2>
            <aside class="notes">
                Getting your code reviewed makes you a better programmer, for the same reason that
                getting your essays graded makes you a better writer. This one is pretty simple.

                But there's also a huge benefit for the reviewer. Who here is or has been an
                undergrad TA or head TA? Remember how much better you learned the material
                when you TA'ed the class than whan you took it originally? Reviewing code is like that.
                It makes you engage with the material on a deeper level. It expands your perspective
                and forces you to re-examine your beliefs about what good code is.

                At Adobe, we rarely did code reviews. At AppDynamics, we do them on every commit.
                As a direct consequence of that, I have learned more about writing clear and correct
                code in the last 9 months at AppDynamics than I did in the previous 5 years at Adobe.<br/>

                When you interview, ask about code reviews. It's very diagnostic. A culture that does code reviews
                is a culture that values quality and craftsmanship. That's the kind of place where you're really going
                to learn.<br/>

            <h2>2) Learn tech that transfers</h2>
            <p>Not proprietary stacks.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                One of the reasons that both Matt and I left Adobe is that we had become experts on Flash, which is
                a dead technology. When we applied to our next jobs, we basically had to apologize for that.
                So one obvious tip is: don't waste time on dead technology.<br/>

                But there's a subtler issue too, which is proprietary technology - technology that is owned and
                maintained only by one group of people. All the reasons that people don't like to USE proprietary
                technology apply at least twofold when it comes to LEARNING proprietary technology. Proprietary
                knowledge is by definition not useful outside of a very small context.
                That means it has virtually no value when you look for your second job.
                I know you're all focused on your first job right now, but you should always keep in mind how your first
                job is going to prepare you for your second job.<br/>

                Now, you might think "isn't it more important that I learn transferable skills, ideas, and principles?"
                Yes, of course that's more important. But when you only know Adobe- or Google- or Facebook-specific
                libraries, you are a little bit boxed in. If you know all the industry-standards, on the other hand,
                you're like a code McGuyver: when you non-technical friend comes along with some startup idea,
                you can just make it happen.<br/>

                I have to say that it's pretty hard to avoid proprietary knowledge at a big company.
                At most big companies, you will be surrounded by layers of proprietary software in every direction.
                Small companies just haven't been around long enough to accumulate that. They also don't have the
                luxury to indulge in "not invented here" syndrome.<br/>

                I also need to make a plug for AppDynamics specifically. Facebook has this amazing VM for running
                PHP code super fast. If you work at Facebook, you can learn how that works. If you work at Google,
                you can learn how about Google's insanely scalable database works. But if you work at AppDynamics,
                you can learn about how NetFlix works, how Williams-Sonoma works, how OpenTable works, how Roku works.
                Because our job is to undestand, and help our customers understand, how these big apps really work.
                It doesn't get much more generally-applicable than that!<br/>

            <h2>3) Get real feedback</h2>
            <aside class="notes">
                The first product I worked on at Adobe was really cool. We talked to potential customers and they
                thought it was cool. In fact, I demoed it in this very building a few years ago, and you guys (or
                your predecessors) thought it was cool too. We worked hard on it for 3 years and shipped it.
                Then we found out there was no real market for it because it didn't <i>really</i> fit into
                anyone's workflow.<br/>

                The "potential customers" didn't mention that part. It's really easy to say "that's so cool, I would
                totally use that!" It's a totally different thing to actually break your habits and change your
                workflow.<br/>

                On my second product, we did it right. We shipped a working version (with a limited feature set)
                three months after we started the project. And people <i>actually</i>
                started using it. They filed bugs! They made feature requests. And we added the things they wanted.
                And we got more users. And it was glorious.<br/>

                I had an interesting experience at AppDynamics that expanded my perspective again. Shortly after
                we shipped my product, my team was in a meeting with the founders and the VP of engineering,
                deciding what to work on next. There were two broad possibilities: features that would make the product
                more useful (since it was fairly limited), and features that would allow us to charge people to
                use the product. I said "I think we should focus on making the product useful before worrying about
                charging for it. Once we have something we know is valuable, then we can charge for it." Jyoti, our CEO
                (who is also an engineer), replied "How will we know if it's valuable if nobody is paying for it?"<br/>

                At first that struck me as just really really...capitalistic. But as I thought about it, I realized
                he had a point: people who are using a free product will not necessarily give you the feedback you need
                to make a product somebody is willing to pay for.<br/>

                Now, I'm not saying this is the only way to do it. What I am saying is that if you want customer
                feedback to help guide your decisions, you need to think hard about how to get the right feedback.<br/>

            <aside class="notes">
                When I looked for my first job, I thought "I want to work on hard problems  with smart people, and maybe
                do something that improves the world". And most of my friends had the same criteria. It's very tempting
                to not worry too much about the business. But there are some business considerations that can have a
                material impact on your career.<br/>

                First, a very harsh reality: if you're not working on something that generates revenue, your project
                is expendable. It doesn't matter what your manager says. It doesn't matter if the CTO is coming around
                your cube every week to check on the status. If it doesn't solve some real problems for some real people
                who know they have these problems and are willing to pay you to solve them, it is a ship adrift on the
                fickle seas of corporate strategy. Maybe the CTO gets pushed out of the company for some reason, and the
                new CTO doesn't understand the value of your product. Maybe the CEO can't figure out how to justify
                the cost on the quarterly earnings call. There are a thousand ways for a product to die. But if it's
                solving real problems for real customers and making money...it has much better chances.<br/>

                Second: it's really valuable talk to non-engineers on a regular basis.
                If you don't talk to the sales team, you really don't know anything about your business.
                The same goes for operations, customer support, and marketing.
                This will make you better at your job. It will make you more valuable to the company.
                You will learn a lot. And if you think you might want to start your own company some day,
                you'll have a huge advantage because you'll know how a business really works.
                Note that this is really hard to do in a big company.<br/>

                Both of these are also much easier to do in small companies. Most small companies don't have the luxury
                of working on non-business-critical things for any length of time. And in a small company, you'll be
                surrounded by non-engineers simply because there aren't enough engineers to buffer you from them.<br/>
